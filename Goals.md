# Goals and progress

## Overall goal
- To look at how irrigation patterns affect soil moisture (VWC), plant health (SWP), and other variables

## Sub-goals

### Clean the data

#### Done so far
- Remove "0" and "-" values from data
- Modified SWP and Irrigation csvs so that they can be plotted together with VWC.

#### Needs to be done
- What to do about bad data?
- Can we smooth curves?

### DTW

### Clustering
- Can we identify individual soil areas that are similar?

### Scatter plots
- Leaf water vs. Soil water content
- Soil water content vs. irrigation input
