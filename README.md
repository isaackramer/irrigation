# irrigation

Final project for course data science course (semester 1/2018).

## Raw Data
- Email from Aviva about TDR data: Hi Isaac, I am sending a Google Drive link which consists of TDR data for May, June and July. Please check that it really downloaded the required time frame (its downloaded directly from the Meteo-tech server so I hope the required dates were actually downloaded). Pay attention that missing data (sensors which are not recording) is being input sometimes as zeroes or as hyphens (-) and not as "NULL", so these data must be removed in order not to insert errors into the analysis. I will be sending also swp data and irrigation data for that period.
- Other data: Units are: swp (mpa) irrigation (m3/dunam) / mm
